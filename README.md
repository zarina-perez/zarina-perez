I’m Zizi, a professional data analyst with experience on more than 13 technical projects. My skills include business analytics, data visualization and storytelling, Python, SQL, and ML. Now, I am eager to leverage my big data and visualization skills in the media & communications sphere to drive growth and boost sales.

Currently, I am working with customer data to find ways of attracting more followers and increasing business metrics. My previous experience in SMM and years of collaborating with clients have helped me develop my communication, analytical, time¬ management, and problem-solving skills. In 2021, I enrolled in the TripleTen 10-month Data Analyst program. The curriculum covered Python (Pandas, NumPy, Beautiful Soup), data visualization (Matplotlib, Plotly, Tableau), machine learning (scikit-learn, NLTK, TensorFlow), SQL, and more. It also involved numerous practical projects.

During my learning journey, I also participated in an externship program, where I completed a business task from the company Norbu, which teaches users how to manage their stress levels and emotions through a user-friendly mobile app. You can learn more about this and my other projects in my repositories!

Some facts about me:

📸 I enjoy participating in professional events, especially those organized by the Women in Data Science community. 
🏃‍♀️I love running, and even used to be the pacemaker on my student track team. 
🗽 At the moment, I am training for the NYC Marathon! 
🥘 I also hate cooking, and would always prefer to order in or eat out. 
🎯 My goals for 2023: landing my dream job in data. And getting a cat!
